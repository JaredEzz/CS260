<h1>Projects</h1>
<h2>Touchbar Information</h2>
<p>This was my first project in React and focused on teaching users what they could do with the TouchBar on the new
    Macbook Pro.
    I focused on a simple, streamlined user interface.</p>
<h2>Get2gether</h2>
<p>My first Flutter project, focused on a clean, intuitive mobile design.</p>
<h2>Let's Go! Companion App</h2>
<p>I've been a Pok√©mon Fan for a while, so I made a companion app to help players track certain in-game progress.</p>
